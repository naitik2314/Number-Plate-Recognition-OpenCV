# Number-Plate-Recognition-OpenCV
Hey, so we have all been there, atleast in India, you need to wait in a queue before entering the parking lot, and the wait is because someone is noting down the Number plate number, which is good, but the method is slow, we are in a world, where speed and efficiency is everything, this code, for now automatically detects and crops the number plate from a locally stored file, but this is a challenge for you, try to add live detection using the webcam, and if the number plate appears the second time, then automatically delete the Number plate stored earlier, which means the car has left the parking lot, good luck...
